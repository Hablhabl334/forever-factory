"""The copywriting skill's AI-tells blacklist, translated for the
factory (batch-3 skills, 2026-11-01).

Doctrine (skills/copywriting/references/ai-tells.md): certain
patterns make copy read machine-written — the "it's not X, it's Y"
contrast reveal, era openers ("in today's world"), recap closers
("in conclusion"), throat-clearing ("here's the thing"), filler
transitions ("moreover"), rhetorical question-then-answers ("The
result?") and a vocabulary of hollow words (delve, tapestry,
unlock, seamless...). A reader who decides a text was generated
starts doubting its claims — on YouTube that reader is the human
AND the recommender, and the platform's inauthentic-content policy
reads the same signals.

Two surfaces, two severities:

* audit(text) — LOG-ONLY on the factory's own text. The hand pools
  use contrast reveals deliberately and sparsely, with concrete
  imagery behind them (the doctrine's own "still fine" clause), so
  hand lines are never rewritten by regex. The per-episode count
  is printed in the log and stored in the ledger, making any future
  drift — a pool edit, a muse slip past the scrubber — visible in
  the noon report instead of invisible in the prose.

* scrub(text) + hard(text) — ENFORCED on the one uncontrolled text
  source in the factory: muse (LLM) output. scrub swaps banned
  vocabulary and strips era openers / throat-clearing / filler /
  recap closers (conservative: never adds facts, never empties a
  line); hard() then reports any tell that survived the scrub, and
  muse's content gate REJECTS that line — the grammar twin ships
  instead, the same fail-safe that already guards fake statistics.

Niche adaptations (deliberate deviations from the source list):
"journey" is NOT banned — in love-psychology the audience uses the
word authentically ("healing journey"), so the doctrine's
frequency-cap reading applies, not a hard ban. "The power of
love" is core niche vocabulary, not an AI tell here. Contrast
reveals are audited, never scrubbed, for the same reason.
